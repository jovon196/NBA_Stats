# NBA Statistics Tracker

 This program would primarily use the web scrape method by grabbing data from Basketball Reference and analyzing it accordingly using code. The casual fans, down to the most diehard NBA fans, can use this program to learn about the sport of basketball or learn more about their favorite players. Users will be able to enter the name of a player, or a season, and be presented with the associated statistics. Beyond the typical stats of points, rebounds, and assists, users will be able to observe advanced stats such as box plus-minus and win shares, and true shooting percentage.
